# ft_ls
A recreation of the 'ls' system utility to list the contents of directories on unix systems.

'a', 'l', 'r', 'R', and 't' flags are available.

Usage:
```
make
./ft_ls [-args] [path]
```
Use the same way you would use the ls that shipped with your system. Works as expected even in the /dev directory.
